## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using regression techniques. By analyzing a USA Real Estate dataset, the project uncovers significant insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and evaluates various regression models for accurate predictions.

## Dataset
**USA Real Estate Dataset**
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemedavar/usausausa)
- Description: Real estate listings in the US categorized by states and zip codes.

## Project Workflow
1. **Loading Dataset & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations**
   - Conducted in-depth analysis to identify key factors influencing house prices.
3. **Regression Algorithms & Model Comparison**
   - Evaluated models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Compared performance using metrics like RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Libraries Used
- Python Libraries:
  - Data Manipulation: `numpy`, `pandas`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`

## Key Features
- Preprocessing and standardizing data using techniques like label encoding and scaling.
- Implementation of multiple regression models.
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and model results.

## Results
- The project identifies the most accurate regression model based on evaluation metrics.
- Provides insights into factors driving house prices in the dataset.
